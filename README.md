# ðŸ’ª NvBased ðŸ’ª

This is my ðŸ’ª BASED ðŸ’ª config for neovim, hope you like it!!!

I had multiple config for my neovim, but this is the best one from all al of them.

If you want this configuration for your own neovim, dont clone this repo, just copy the code and modify it, cause there's a few things that you must change or modify to make this config to work, like the vim plug, git, fzf, etc. This config only works on Windows, it doesnt work on linux or mac, i already try it on linux and it doesnt work and you need to modify a lot of the config.
